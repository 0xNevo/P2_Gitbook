# The AI Engine

The Predictive Perpetuals AI engine uses a hybrid of on-chain and off-chain models to:
- Analyze market sentiment and volatility.
- Adjust funding dynamically.
- Provide risk signals to users and LPs.

This transforms traditional prediction markets into adaptive, data-driven ecosystems.
