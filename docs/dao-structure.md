# DAO Structure

The **Predictive Perpetuals DAO (P² DAO)** is the decentralized governance layer that oversees the evolution, transparency, and sustainability of the Predictive Perpetuals ecosystem.

It ensures that all critical parameters — from AI model governance to liquidity incentives — are managed by the community, not a centralized team.

The DAO operates on the **BNB Chain**, leveraging **on-chain voting, proposal execution, and treasury control** to maintain transparent and autonomous platform growth.



### Core Objectives

* 🧠 **AI Governance:** Oversee updates to the AI risk engine, funding algorithms, and oracle weighting models.
* ⚖️ **Protocol Parameters:** Adjust leverage limits, fee tiers, and collateral ratios through decentralized proposals.
* 💰 **Treasury Management:** Allocate ecosystem funds for audits, marketing, liquidity incentives, and grants.
* 🪙 **Token Utility Evolution:** Define new $P2 token use cases or reward programs as the protocol expands.
* 🌐 **Ecosystem Expansion:** Approve partnerships, cross-chain deployments, and integrations with third-party protocols.



### DAO Governance Layers

#### 1. **Community Layer**

The foundation of the DAO — composed of all $P2 holders.\
Community members can:

* Submit or endorse proposals
* Vote on governance items
* Participate in discussions through governance forums and Discord channels

> Minimum token holdings may be required to submit formal proposals (e.g., 10,000 $P2).

***

#### 2. **Delegate Layer**

Elected delegates represent the broader community.\
They specialize in specific domains:

* **AI Governance Council:** Oversees AI model updates and risk calibration.
* **Risk & Treasury Council:** Manages treasury distributions and liquidity programs.
* **Growth & Ecosystem Council:** Approves partnerships and new market categories.

Delegates are voted in by $P2 holders and are subject to periodic re-election cycles.

***

#### 3. **Core Contributors**

The operational team executing DAO-approved upgrades and initiatives.\
This includes:

* Smart contract developers
* AI engineers
* Risk analysts
* Community coordinators

Core contributors are funded through DAO-approved budgets and must provide transparent quarterly reports.

***

#### 4. **Treasury Committee**

A multisig group responsible for executing approved treasury transactions on-chain.\
They ensure:

* Proper fund allocation according to DAO votes
* Emergency response capability (e.g., halting unsafe parameters)
* Transparent financial reporting

***

### Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation**
   * Any holder meeting the minimum threshold can submit a proposal via the **Governance Portal**.
   * Proposals include a title, summary, rationale, and technical implementation details.
2. **Discussion Phase**
   * The proposal is discussed publicly on the forum or Discord for feedback.
   * Amendments may be made before formal voting.
3. **Voting Phase**
   * Voting occurs on-chain using $P2 tokens as governance weight.
   * Each token equals one vote; quorum thresholds apply.
4. **Execution Phase**
   * Approved proposals are automatically executed by the DAO’s governance smart contracts.
   * Results and transaction proofs are published on the Governance Portal.

***

### Future DAO Enhancements

* **Quadratic Voting** to improve fairness across small and large holders
* **AI-Assisted Proposal Evaluation** to summarize key risks and impacts before voting
* **Cross-Chain DAO Representation** for governance over multi-chain deployments
* **Reputation-Based Roles** for contributors with a history of valuable input
