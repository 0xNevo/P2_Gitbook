# What Are Predictive Perpetuals?

Predictive Perpetuals (P²) let traders speculate not on *what happens*, but on *how likely* it is to happen.

Each market tracks a **probability index (0–1)** representing the collective belief of an event occurring.

> Instead of betting “yes” or “no”, you can go long or short on *the probability itself* — with leverage and real-time PnL.
