# Introduction

Trade the **probability of future real-world events** with leverage, dynamic funding, and on-chain governance.

> Predictive Perpetuals (P²) merges prediction markets and perpetual DEXs into one — creating a new way to trade _beliefs as assets_.

***

\
Predictive Perpetuals (P²) let traders speculate not on _what happens_, but on _how likely_ it is to happen.

Each market tracks a **probability index (0–1)** representing the collective belief of an event occurring.

> Instead of betting “yes” or “no”, you can go long or short on _the probability itself_ — with leverage and real-time PnL.
